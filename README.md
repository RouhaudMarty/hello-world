# hello-world
Just another Hello World Repository... I wonder how many of these there is on GitHub?
Her's how to write a helloWorld program in java:
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.println ("Hello, World!");
    }
  }
// This is a Hello World program with some commentary.
